            <td><ul>
		    <li>Help your friend or family member be organzied and set up little mini goals for big tasks. For example
		    for big class projects, instead of not having a structured timeline, create mini deadlines on what
		    should be done and how.</li>
		    <li>Ask teachers for help and tell them what's gooing on. A teacher is there for you to succeed but,
		    they can't help unless they know what's going on. </li>
		    <li>Make sure to keep track of your friend or family member. Not so much of an extent as where it becomes 
		    annoying, but ask them how their days are doing and what's been going on at home. Let them know that you're
		    there as a helping hand.</li>  
		    <li>Be mindful of someone's specific needs. It's grest to help and treat someone normal, but do recognize that in 
		    order for them to be the best in their ability, they may need more help then others and that's okay. </li>
		    <li>Be prepared for anything. Autisim is not the same for everyone. It can effect any person completely different
		    than others. No single person is the same and so the way that Autism might effect one person, can be completely 
		    different to another.</li>
		    
		</ul>
		</td>
		
           <td><ul>
		    <li>expect someone to be fine on their own. Though it may seem annoying or tedious, the best way to help
		    one succeed in anything is to be there for them as a reference, guide or helping hand.</li>
		    <li>Keep yourself trapped in a block. It's fine to not know what to do, but make sure to find a way out 
		    of the situation. </li>
		    <li>Do not overlook bad behavior just because of their disorder. Bad behavior is bad behavior, the way you
		    discipline bad behavior should be different than for someone with a no disorder.</li>
		    <li>Don't let people bully someone with an autism disorder. You must speak out, just because someone is 
		    autisic doen't mean they don't have feelings. You must always speak out against bullying and help those who
		    are being bullied.</li>
